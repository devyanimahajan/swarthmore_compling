The Pipe Song
I say to you,
I say to you
 
The pipe is so very sacred,
We offer our prayers with it, here it is
 
The circle is sacred as well,
We pray within it, it is here
 
The pipe is so very sacred,
We offer our prayers with it, here it is
 
The circle is sacred as well,
We pray within it, it is here

The people gave this to me...

I am tired
I look at them
This canary is tired
I look at the dog
This is an acorn
I walk but they all sleep
The cat catches the oriole at the store
He takes a potato
The dog sits in front of the apple
The book is beside the pencil
